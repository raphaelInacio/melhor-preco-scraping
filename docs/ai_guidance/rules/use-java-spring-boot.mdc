# Backend Technology: Java and Spring Boot

For the backend of this project, we will use **Java** with the **Spring Boot** framework. This choice provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for our application.

## Why Java and Spring Boot?

1.  **Maturity and Ecosystem**: Java is a mature language with a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools. The Spring Framework builds on this, providing comprehensive solutions for nearly every aspect of enterprise application development.

2.  **Performance**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a highly optimized runtime environment. With modern garbage collectors and JIT compilation, Java applications offer excellent performance and can handle high-throughput workloads.

3.  **Type Safety**: Java's static typing catches many common errors at compile time, leading to more reliable and maintainable code compared to dynamically typed languages.

4.  **Developer Productivity**: Spring Boot radically simplifies Spring development. Features like auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and an embedded server allow developers to get applications up and running with minimal configuration.

5.  **Community and Support**: Both Java and Spring have massive, active communities. This means extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support are readily available.

6.  **Scalability and Concurrency**: Java has strong built-in support for multithreading. Frameworks like Spring make it easy to build scalable, concurrent applications that can take full advantage of modern multi-core processors.

## Key Tools and Libraries

-   **Build Tool**: **Maven** or **Gradle** for dependency management and building the project.
-   **Web Framework**: **Spring Web (MVC)** for building REST APIs and web applications.
-   **Data Access**: **Spring Data JPA** with **Hibernate** for interacting with the database.
-   **Testing**: **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**, and **Spring Test** for comprehensive testing.
-   **Security**: **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization.

## Getting Started

-   Use the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to bootstrap a new Spring Boot project.
-   Follow the conventions and best practices outlined in the other rule documents (`code-standards.mdc`, `api-rest-http.mdc`, etc.).
